mcp2200hid-linux
================

This is two very simple utility for using the HID interface of Microchip's MCP2200 USB bridge 
(http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/devices.aspx?dDocName=en546923) on linux. It's mostly based on their
application note: TB3066 MCP2200 HID Interface Command Description 
(http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/93066A.pdf), a bit reverse engineering, 
and this description: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12746744/mcp2200-linux-settings/23106926#23106926

To use it, see the help of the binaries (e.g. mcp2200gpio -h).
